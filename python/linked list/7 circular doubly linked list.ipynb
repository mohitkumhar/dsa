    "    &rarr; You can move both forwards and backwards through the list.\n",
    "    &rarr; The list has no end, which is useful for applications requiring continuous looping, like in some gaming scenarios.\n",

    "    &rarr; Improper handling can lead to infinite loops since there's no null end to stop traversal.\n",
