    "A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes. It is a way to organize data in a hierarchical form.\n",

    "## → Key Terms\n",
    "- **Node**: Basic unit of a tree, containing a value or data.\n",
    "- **Root**: The top node of a tree, where the hierarchy starts.\n",
    "- **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.\n",
    "- **Parent**: A node directly connected to another node when moving towards the root.\n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node that does not have any children.\n",
    "- **Edge**: The connection between two nodes.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.\n",
    "- **Height**: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n",
    "- **Depth**: The number of edges from the root to the node.\n",

    "- **Acyclic**: Trees do not contain cycles.\n",

    "## → Types of Trees\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children (left and right).\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent node, and the right child is greater.\n",
    "- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.\n",
    "- **B-Tree**: A self-balancing search tree, optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.\n",
    "- **Trie**: A tree used to store dynamic sets of strings, where the keys are usually strings.\n",
